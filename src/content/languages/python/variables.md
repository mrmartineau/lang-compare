title: Variables
order: 1

Variables are dynamically typed. No declaration keyword needed — just assign.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
is_active = True

# Multiple assignment
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

# Swap
a, b = b, a

# Constants (convention only, not enforced)
MAX_SIZE = 100

# Type hints (optional, for tooling)
count: int = 0
label: str = "hello"
```
